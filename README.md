🚴‍♂️ IoT-Based Cyclist Safety System
Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing cyclist safety using an IoT-based anomaly detection system. The system utilizes ESP32, MPU6050 (accelerometer & gyroscope), and machine learning models to detect falls, crashes, and abnormal cycling behaviors. When an anomaly is detected, real-time alerts are sent to the user and emergency contacts via a web-based dashboard.

Key Features
✅ Anomaly Detection: Detects sudden falls, abnormal speed variations, and crash patterns using ML/DL models
✅ Real-Time Data Monitoring: Live sensor data visualization through a responsive web dashboard
✅ AI-Based Predictions: Uses LSTM, Isolation Forest, and CNN models for safety alerts
✅ User Authentication: Secure login for cyclists and emergency responders
✅ IoT Integration: ESP32 processes data locally and sends alerts via MQTT/WebSockets

Tech Stack
🛠 Frontend: React.js (Dashboard, UI)
🛠 Backend: Node.js (API, WebSockets), Firebase/Express.js
🛠 ML Models: TensorFlow Lite for ESP32 deployment
🛠 Hardware: ESP32, MPU6050, GPS Module

This system ensures cyclist safety with proactive AI-driven alerts 🚴💡.
